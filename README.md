### [Download](https://github.com/natemcmaster/alfred-sublime-text-workspace/raw/master/dist/sublime-text-workspace.alfredworkflow)

Version v0.1.1

This workflow finds all recent workspaces you have opened in Sublime Text and launches them. Because workspaces are usually paired with projects, this is a great way to quickly launch projects.
